# Oystercard Challenge

Makers Academy Week 2

## Main Objectives
- Are you having fun?
- Are you a better developer than you were yesterday?
- Can you use object-oriented design principles to write better code?

## Method

- We were given the week to work through 16 challenges that build on each other in rotating pairs. The over-arching instructions were to fulfil this spec:
> This week's challenge will start with going back over the basics we covered last week in Boris Bikes, giving you the chance to reinforce what you learned last week. You'll then be challenged to build a more complex system which should really stretch your skills in Ruby, TDD and object-oriented design.

> A mini project designed to recreate the London Underground Oystercard system, allowing a user to touch in and out at stations, log and view their travel history.
